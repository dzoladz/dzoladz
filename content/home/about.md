# Biography

Hi! I'm the Project Coordinator for the [Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL)](https://www.cool-cat.org/eg/opac/home), a collaborative of independent libraries pioneering the use of an open-source library system: [Evergreen ILS](https://evergreen-ils.org). You'll also find me involved with a broad range of library-related technology management and support services to Ohio's public, academic, special libraries, and cultural heritage institutions.
