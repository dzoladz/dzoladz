# Biography

Early life in the microscopic village of [Rayland, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayland,_Ohio). Raised on Pittsburgh Pirates baseball, Maxwell House coffee, and a cavalcade of books. My favorite place to read is on a long flight. Waiting patiently for me, on my personal library's bookshelves are: [The Stack](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/964027177), [Tar for Mortar](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1031482467), [The Weird and the Eerie](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/992465560), [The Arsenal of Exclusion & Inclusion](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1020148007).
