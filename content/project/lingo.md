Ohioâ€™s first ILEAD USA, a multi-state program designed to help library staff understand and respond to user needs through the application of participatory technology tools. 

Ohio participants will join others from Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, and Utah in this national initiative.  Zoladz and Zavaloff will be assigned to teams that will work on a single group project to address at least one identified need within their communities of users.
ILEAD USA is funded by a Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program grant to the State Library of Illinois from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

ILEAD USA is an immersive continuing education program that develops library leaders through projects based on community needs using technology.  As part of the first in-person session in March, teams had only a few hours each evening to create short videos explaining their projects.

Our idea of what we would try to do changed quite a bit, from a dictionary to a classification translator tool.

Our final pitch of the application was to our local library administration, participating organizations and team partners, and the State Library of Ohio Board.
